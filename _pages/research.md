Our research efforts focus on the following two interconnected areas: 
 1. **motion correction** that can reduce motion artifacts and artifact-induced errors in quantification results; 
 2. **quantitative MRI** that derives physioloigcally meaningful parameters.


## 1. Motion correction

 The early intervention and accurate diagnosis of brain  diseases rely on high-quality MRI images. However, motion artifacts seriously
 affect the image quality and the accuracy of quantification results. Elimination of motion artifacts entails accurate measurement of head positions and modelling of artifact mechanisms which include:
   - motion-induced k-space coordinate errors;
   - B0 field changes;
   - coil sensitivity changes, which can all in turn affect measured MRI signal.
 
Our research aims to develop hybrid motion measurement techniques to achieve fast and reliable head motion measurement. Ongoing techniques under development include fat navigators that can provide stable motion parameter measurement and motion sensitive electromagentic induction coils that can has higher temporal resolution.

Based on the measured motion parameters, we are devloping methods that can correct the above motion-induced effects in the clinical MRI sequences. To correct for B0 field and coil sensitivity changes, we are developing physical and neural network models that can predict motion-induced B0 field and coil sensitivity changes from motion parameters.


## 2. Quantitative MRI

 MRI can not only produce images of the human interior,
 but also is capable of deriving physical and physiologically meaningful parameters such as flow velocity, blood volume, blood oxygenation, vessel diameter, and temparature.  
It can be argued that such parameters can provide deeper insight into the inner functioning and dysfunctioning of the human body than purely MRI based parameters such as functional connectivity, BOLD activation amplitude, and NMR relaxation rates which can be affected by a multitude of underlying factors, and are thus hard to interpret.  
Our research builds physical models that bridges the gap between the properties of imaged objects (such as blood vessel, cerebral spinal fluid, muscle) and MRI signal, thus enabling us to derive quantitative measures of the objects using MRI. 

To reduce model complexity, 2D MRI with limited spatial coverage is often adopted.  Motion correction is an integral part of quantitative MRI, especially in 2D MRI.  It not only enables consistent placement of imaging slice in longitudinal studies, but also ensures accurate quantifcation results.
