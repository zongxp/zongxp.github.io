The MRI physics lab at ShanghaiTech University directed by Prof. Zong focuses on the development of MRI methods that can facilitate our understanding of human brain 
function and the diagnosis of neurological diseases. Emphasis is given to the development of methods that can produce quantative, interpretable, and reproducible results.  Current research efforts include the following two synergetically interconnected areas: 1) motion correction that can reduce motion artifacts and artifact-induced errors in quantification results; 2) quantitative MRI that derives physioloigcally meaningful parameters.


## Motion correction

 The early intervention and accurate diagnosis of brain
 diseases rely on high-quality MRI images, however, motion artifacts seriously
 affect the image quality and the accuracy of quantification results. Elimination of motion artifacts entails accurate measurement of head positions and accurate modelling of artifact mechanisms which include motion-induced k-space coordinate errors, B0 field
changes, coil sensitivity changes, which can all in turn affect measured MRI signal.  Our research aims to develop hybrid motion measurement techniques such as fat navigators and motion sensitive electromagentic induction coils that can leverage the strengths of the different techniques to achieve fast and reliable head motion measurement.


## Quantitative MRI

  MRI can not only produce images of the human interior, but also is capable of deriving physical and physiologically meaningful parameters such as flow velocity, blood volume, blood oxygenation, vessel diameter, and temparature.  It can be argued that such parameters can provide deeper insight into the inner functioning and dysfunctioning of the human body than purely MRI based parameters such as functional connectivity, BOLD activation amplitude, and NMR relaxation rates which can be affected by a multitude of underlying factors, and are thus hard to interpret.  Our research builds physical models that bridges the gap between the properties of imaged objects (such as blood vessel, cerebral spinal fluid, muscle) and MRI signal, thus enabling us to derive quantitative measures of the objects using MRI. 

To reduce model complexity, 2D MRI with limited spatial coverage is often adopted.  Motion correction is an integral part of quantitative MRI, especially in 2D MRI.  It not only ensures accurate quantifcation results but also enables consistent placement of imaging slice in longitudinal studies.
