The MRI physics lab at ShanghaiTech University directed by Prof. Zong focuses on the development of MRI methods 
that facilitate our understanding of human brain function and the diagnosis of neurological diseases. 
We emphasize the development of methods that provide quantitative and physiologically meaningful results.
