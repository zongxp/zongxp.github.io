“核磁共振影像与波谱信号”是生物医学工程学院的一门专业选修课。本课程基于磁共振物理学对核磁共振图像和波谱信号产生过程中的所涉及的各种物理现象进行定量分析，使学生能更深刻地理解磁共振图像和波谱的产生机制，从而能在今后的科研中更有效地使用磁共振技术，更科学准确地理解和诠释磁共振实验结果。

“MRI and MRS signals” is an elective course offered by the School of Biomedical Engineering.  This course will apply MR physics to quantitatively analyze the various phenomena involved in the generation of MRI and MRS signals, thus deepening students’ understanding the mechanisms underlying the MR images and spectra.  It will enable more effective utilization of the MRI scanners, and more accurate understanding and interpretation of MRI and MRS experimental data.
